#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1) SE Era I: Mastering the Machine (1956–1967). The term
software engineering had not yet been coined. Code devel-
opment was strongly influenced by outside forces. The main
purpose of any piece of software was to optimize exploitation
of the limited hardware resources. The first compilers were
defined; operating systems were noninteractive. These prim-
itive environments continued evolving up to the definition
of the first low-level Computer Aided Software Engineering
tools (CASE tools) facilitating interactive editing, compiling,
and debugging. The lack of software development methods
led to high risk and the origin of a new stage is easily
noticeable.
2) SE Era II: Mastering the Process (1968–1982). The first
software crisis in this stage led to the birth of software
engineering [1]. The aim was to reduce risk during devel-
opment and improve quality and productivity. Software
development methodologies appeared to define and monitor
software building. An important contribution of this stage
was the formal modeling approach that enables implementa-
tion automation. But for industry, this formal approach was
unfeasible due to a lack of tools and training. Furthermore,
formal methods become unmanageable for large system
development. In conclusion, in this stage, the need to focus
on predesign phases and the use of more or less formal
models for software specification began to appear. A num-
ber of structured methods, such as Software Requirement
Engineering Methodology (SREM) [7] and the Structured
Analysis and Design Technique (SADT) [8] were developed
allowing the development of specification documents for
business management software.
3)  SE Era III: Mastering the Complexity (1983–1992). The
up to then dominion of hardware over software ended. Per-
sonal computers arrived and opened the fields of computer
applications. The software development process would now
comprehensively address analysis and design from the spec-
ification. Graphical user interface and visual programming
brought software closer to customers. The use of structured
family and data modeling methodologies was extended
[9]. Several CASE tools facilitated software development.
However, data modeling (database) and function modeling
(structured methods) still followed separate paths. These two
modeling paths converged in object-oriented (OO) methods
like early on in structured methodologies, they were first introduced in coding and design, and finally in specification
and analysis [10–12]. This approach enables efficient reuse of
object-oriented software and thus improves building software
productivity.
4) SE Era IV: Mastering the Communications (1993–2001).
The emergence of the Internet brought with it a new software
concept. The decentralization of functions and data led to
the rapid development and expansion of areas of computing,
such as concurrent programming and distributed architec-
tures, which up to then had been limited to a narrower
context. In addition to client/server applications, and in
general, any distributed system development, there was now a
new engineering software discipline called Web engineering
[13]. Moreover, software development was viewed as an
industrial process in which quality should be monitored. This
requires an effective separation between process and product.
Some tasks related to managing and improving both the
product and process appeared as new SE components, such
as CMM (capability maturity model) and CMMI (capability
maturity model integrated) [14]. 



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Stage-1: Planning and Requirement Analysis
Planning is a crucial step in everything, just as in software development. In this same stage, requirement analysis is also performed by the developers of the organization. This is attained from customer inputs, and sales department/market surveys. 

The information from this analysis forms the building blocks of a basic project. The quality of the project is a result of planning. Thus, in this stage, the basic project is designed with all the available information.

Stage-2: Defining Requirements
In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are specified. These requirements get approval from customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. 
This is fulfilled by utilizing SRS (Software Requirement Specification). This is a sort of document that specifies all those things that need to be defined and created during the entire project cycle. 

Stage-3: Designing Architecture
SRS is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software. Hence, with the requirements defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the Design Document Specification (DDS). 

This DDS is assessed by market analysts and stakeholders. After evaluating all the possible factors, the most practical and logical design is chosen for development.

Stage-4: Developing Product
At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the DDS. Hence, it is important for the coders to follow the protocols set by the association. Conventional programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are also put into use at this stage. Some popular languages like C/C++, Python, Java, etc. are put into use as per the software regulations. 

Stage-5: Product Testing and Integration
After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution. Although, minimal testing is conducted at every stage of SDLC. Therefore, at this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and retested. This ensures that the product confronts the quality requirements of SRS. 

Documentation, Training, and Support: Software documentation is an essential part of the software development life cycle. A well-written document acts as a tool and means to information repository necessary to know about software processes, functions, and maintenance. Documentation also provides information about how to use the product. Training in an attempt to improve the current or future employee performance by increasing an employee’s ability to work through learning, usually by changing his attitude and developing his skills and understanding. 

Stage-6: Deployment and Maintenance of Products
After detailed testing, the conclusive product is released in phases as per the organization’s strategy. Then it is tested in a real industrial environment. It is important to ensure its smooth performance. If it performs well, the organization sends out the product as a whole. After retrieving beneficial feedback, the company releases it as it is or with auxiliary improvements to make it further helpful for the customers. However, this alone is not enough. Therefore, along with the deployment, the product’s supervision. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Similarities between agile and waterfall testing

Despite their differences, agile and waterfall testing also have some similarities. Both methods aim to ensure the quality and functionality of the software, and to satisfy the customer's requirements and expectations. Both methods use various types of testing techniques and tools, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, regression testing, performance testing, automation testing, etc. Both methods also follow some common principles and practices of software testing, such as test design, test execution, test reporting, test management, etc.

Differences between agile and waterfall 

One of the main differences between agile and waterfall testing is the timing and frequency of testing. In waterfall testing, testing is done once, at the end of the development phase, and it may take a long time to complete. In agile testing, testing is done throughout the project, in every sprint, and it is done in parallel with development. This means that agile testing can detect and fix defects earlier, reduce rework, and deliver faster feedback.

Another difference is the scope and flexibility of testing. In waterfall testing, testing is based on a fixed scope and requirements that are defined upfront and rarely change. In agile testing, testing is based on a dynamic scope and requirements that are constantly evolving and prioritized by the customer. This means that waterfall testing can ensure compliance and completeness of the software, but it may not meet the changing needs and preferences of the customer. Agile testing can respond to changes and deliver value to the customer, but it may not cover all the possible scenarios and risks of the software.
